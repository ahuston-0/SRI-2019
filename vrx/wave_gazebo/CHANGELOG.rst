Changelog for package wave_gazebo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.1.1 (2019-07-03)
------------------
* Missing ruby in build depend for wave_gazebo
* Contributors: Jose Luis Rivero <jrivero@osrfoundation.org>

1.1.0 (2019-07-01)
------------------
* Generate changelog for new packages
* merge with default
* changing buoy buoyancy to sphere, adding feature to generator
* Tweaks
* ready
* Connecting wave model to buoyancy plugin
* working version with dock buoyancy, but need to attach placards
* first cut - dock elements work, but to build a full dock need to add joints between elements
* tweaks
* Merged in wave_visualization_refactor (pull request #114)
  Wave visual / physics refactor
  Approved-by: Carlos Ag端ero <cen.aguero@gmail.com>
* Restoring waves parameters.
* Smooth water.
* Style
* reducing wave height to something more reasonable
* removing the ocean_waves model.sdf since it is generated via erb
* Using Ruby to generate ocean wave model SDF
* testing side by side scaling
* case 0
* temporary branch for comparing with wave_visualization
* Testing scalability of new implementation - updated hgignore vmrc->vrx
* Removed gazebo messaging, introduces redundancy in model.sdf for ocean. USV and buoyancy plugins only get wave parameters once instead of every update.
* setting model back to original seastate
* style
* adding to docs and allowing for both PMS and CWR wavefield models
* addin PM spectrum
* testing wave fields
* adding exponential increase in wave field and LaTeX doc^C
* increment
* Clean up some of the diagnostic messages
* Added wavegauge plugin to visualize physical wave height.  Setup example with buoy world.  Implemented simplified wave height calculation in WavefieldSampler for regularly spaced grid (steepness=1=0).
* verifying with examples
* toward buoy examples
* Removing superfluous models and empty tests
* Changing license text
* Modifications from original source for integration in VRX
* Adding two packages from asv_wave_sim as a part of VRC
