# WAM-V Autonomous Vessel Navigation
This repository, alongside the repository managed by @uasif13, is responsible for the autonomous navigation a WAM-V 16 ASV. The current resources here allow developers to collect camera images through ROS and Gazebo then determine the location of buoys. All work here has been tested with the Virtual RobotX simulation environment with the eventual goal of traversing between sets of buoys and then eventually reaching full autonomous movement and obstacle avoidance.

## Getting Started
These instructions should allow you to get the project up and running on your system.

### Prerequisites
Install ROS and the Virtual RobotX (VRX) environment using either of the installation methods that VRX offers. Note that if you install the VRX Docker image that you will still need a copy of ROS on your local machine in order to interact with Gazebo on Docker.
  
In addition, users should install the following Python packages (versions are the latest tested):
* OpenCV (version > 4.0.0)
* NumPy (version = 1.16.4)
* Matplotlib (version = 3.1.0)
* Scikit-learn (version = 0.21.2)
